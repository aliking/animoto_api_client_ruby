      #
      # Once a class is declared as an adapter, will set this module to autoload the
      # file on first reference, and sets a key in the #adapter_map mapping the normalized
      # name of the adapter (in the case of ChunkyBaconAdapter, the normalized name is
      # "chunkybacon").
      #
      # The class can be accessed by its normalized name through the #[] method, or simply
      # referenced directly through a #const_missing hook. Using #const_missing will normalize
      # the name of the constant and look it up in the #adapter_map, so capitalization (or even
      # punctuation) need not be exact.
